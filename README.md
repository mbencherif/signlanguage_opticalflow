# signlanguage_opticalflow

The code provided (sign_analysis.m) uses previously published optical flow code (flow_code/) to analyze sign language videos and output flow magnitude and angle data for each frame. 

This data can be used for a number of things, like getting a gross measure of movement (i.e., sonority) or even training a machine learning algorithm to identify certain sign features related to movement.
